# LAN-Chat-Server

This Project can be used for chatting in Local Area Network.
Also this is my college project.<br>
I am currently working on this project to integrate OTP authentication login

Run `main.py` to chat with you LAN users

## Setup

Ensure you have python 3.6+ installed.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Messages Stored
The chat messages are stored in `messages.db` file. To clear the message history simply delete the `messages.db` file.
